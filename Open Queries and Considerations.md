# HBase Connection Details
## Query: How do I configure the connection to HBase?
Details: Ensure that the Zookeeper quorum and client port are correctly specified in the nifi_flow.xml and the Spark job.

# AWS S3 Credentials
## Query: How do I securely manage AWS credentials?
Details: Use environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) or IAM roles for authentication. Avoid hardcoding credentials.

# Filename Generation in Nifi
## Query: How is the filename generated in Nifi?
Details: The filename is generated using the current timestamp in the UpdateAttribute processor to ensure uniqueness.

# Data Transformation in Spark
## Query: How are the HBase records transformed before writing to Delta Lake?
Details: The Spark job reads HBase records, maps them to a DataFrame, and then writes the DataFrame to Delta Lake.

# Handling Incremental Data
## Query: How is incremental data handled?
Details: The HBase scan uses a timestamp filter to fetch only new or updated records since the last run.

# Error Handling and Retries in Nifi
## Query: What happens if a processor in Nifi fails?
Details: Configure failure relationships in Nifi to handle errors, such as retrying the flow or routing to an error queue.

# Spark Job Configuration
## Query: How do I configure and run the Spark job?
Details: Use spark-submit with appropriate parameters, ensuring that the Spark environment has the necessary dependencies for HBase and AWS S3.

# Databricks Delta Lake Configuration
## Query: How do I configure Delta Lake in Databricks to read from S3?
Details: Ensure that Databricks has the correct IAM roles and permissions to access the S3 bucket and that the Delta Lake path is correctly specified.

# Performance Optimization
## Query: How can I optimize the performance of the data transfer?
Details: Adjust the caching and parallelism settings in both Nifi and Spark to optimize performance. Use appropriate cluster resources for Spark jobs.

# Schema Evolution in Delta Lake
## Query: How does Delta Lake handle schema changes?
Details: Delta Lake supports schema evolution, but you need to manage and review schema changes to ensure compatibility.

# Monitoring and Logging
## Query: How can I monitor the data transfer process?
Details: Use Nifi’s built-in monitoring tools and Spark’s logging framework to track the progress and status of the data transfer.

# Security Considerations
## Query: How do I ensure the security of the data transfer?
Details: Use secure communication protocols (TLS/SSL) for data transfer, manage access controls, and encrypt sensitive data.

# Handling Large Data Volumes
## Query: How do I handle large volumes of data?
Details: Ensure that both Nifi and Spark are configured to handle large datasets efficiently. Consider using partitioning and bucketing in Delta Lake.

# Data Consistency and Integrity
## Query: How do I ensure data consistency and integrity?
Details: Implement checks and validation mechanisms in both Nifi and Spark to ensure that the data is correctly transferred and consistent.

# Error and Exception Handling in Spark
## Query: How does the Spark job handle errors and exceptions?
Details: Implement appropriate error handling in the Spark job to catch and log exceptions, ensuring the job can gracefully handle failures.

# Compatibility with Different HBase Versions
## Query: Is the solution compatible with different HBase versions?
Details: Test the solution with the specific version of HBase used in your environment and adjust configurations if necessary.
