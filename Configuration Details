Nifi
GetHBase Processor: Reads data from HBase using a timestamp filter for incremental extraction.
UpdateAttribute Processor: Generates a unique filename for each data extract.
PutS3Object Processor: Writes the extracted data directly to AWS S3.
Spark
HBaseToDeltaLake.scala: Contains the Spark job to read data from HBase, transform it, and write it to Databricks Delta Lake.
Notes
Ensure proper IAM roles and permissions are set for accessing AWS S3.
Modify the configuration files to fit your specific environment and requirements.

With these modifications, you should have a complete, working example for transferring data from HBase to Databricks using Apache Nifi and Spark.
